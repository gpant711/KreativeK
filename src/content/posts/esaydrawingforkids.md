How it helps: This freeform exercise helps unlock their imagination and reduces perfectionism, allowing creativity to flow naturally.
Tip: Keep a [sketchbook](https://amzn.to/4eWrlgX) on hand so kids can doodle whenever inspiration strikes.

They can use different lines, shapes, and colors to express the mood of the music.
How it helps: Drawing to music taps into emotional expression and encourages kids to explore abstract concepts.

imperfection.

into something recognizable, like an animal, face, or object.

they can look up a picture of the animal and compare.
How it helps: This exercise challenges kids' memory and imagination while strengthening their observation skills.
Tip: Pair this with a kids' [animal art book](https://amzn.to/3YAv260) that teaches basic animal drawing techniques for extra learning.

## 7. Upside-Down Drawing
Exercise: Print out a simple drawing (like a cartoon character or a basic landscape) and tape it upside down on the table.
Ask your child to try drawing it upside down.

## 8. Mix-and-Match Creatures
Exercise: On a piece of paper, draw three sections: the head, body, and legs. Ask your child to draw different parts of a creature 
in each section (they can combine different animals, 
like a lion’s head, an elephant’s body, and a bird’s legs). Fold the paper after each section is drawn, so they can’t see the previous part.
How it helps: This game-like exercise encourages creativity and shows that art can be fun and unpredictable.
Tip: Have a [set of crayon](https://amzn.to/3BUYuL7) ready to color the wild and wacky creations!

Exercise: Take a piece of paper and place it over textured surfaces around your house or outdoors, like a leaf, coin, or fabric. Have your child rub over
the paper with a crayon to capture the texture.
How it helps: This hands-on activity introduces kids to the concept of texture and helps them explore their environment in a new way.
Tip: Use crayons with multiple colors for more exciting textures and patterns.
